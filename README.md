# InstaFollowers
InstaStats.py is a straightforward Python script designed to help you identify individuals who do not follow you back on Instagram. Importantly, it does not access your Instagram account, ensuring your privacy and safety are maintained, and minimizing the risk of receiving any bans from Instagram. However, please be aware that I am not a professional, and I cannot assume liability for any potential damages that may arise from using this script.

To use this Python script, you must first request and download a copy of your Instagram information. To do this, navigate to the Activity tab on your Instagram account. Under this tab, you should find an option to download your information. When making the request, please select the lowest quality and choose the JSON format.
It's worth noting that it's not necessary to download all of your information; you can opt for specifically downloading the 'Followers' and 'Following' data.
Once you have received the downloaded information, extract the 'followers_1.json' and 'following.json' files, and place them in the same directory as the InstaStats.py script. Afterward, you can run the script with the bellow command:

```
$ python3 InstaStats.py
```
